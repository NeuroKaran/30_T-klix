While related to my overall functioning, \"skill commands\" (my internal concept) and \"system prompts\" serve different purposes:\n\n1.  **System Prompts:** These are the initial, overarching instructions given to me by my developers. They define my core identity, my role (e.g., \"expert AI coding assistant\"), my capabilities, and the general rules of engagement (e.g., \"only use tools when strictly necessary,\" \"be concise\"). They set the high-level context for all my interactions.\n\n2.  **Skill Commands (my internal concept):** As I mentioned, this is my internal way of categorizing *types of tasks* I can perform. When you ask me to do something, I internally map that request to one or more of these \"skills\" (e.g., \"read file,\" \"write code,\" \"search web\"). This helps me decide which specific tool or internal process to use.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n*   **System Prompts** are like my job description and company policy.\n*   **Skill Commands** are like the list of services I offer (e.g., \"plumbing,\" \"electrical work,\" \"painting\").\n*   The actual **tool calls** (like `read_file`, `web_search`) are the specific tools I use to perform those services.\n\nSo, while system prompts define *who I am* and *how I should operate*, skill commands are more about *what I can do* and help me translate your requests into concrete actions.",
